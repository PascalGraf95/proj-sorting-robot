# Sorting screws and other unknown objects based on image features in a unsupervised fashion using DoBot Magician

## General Information
- This project has its origin  from a batchelor thesis assignment which was worked out by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Nicolaj Stache.
- The supervisor of the thesis is M.Eng. Pascal Graf.
- This program code was developed by Dominic Doetterer(Mat-Nr.201974) & Pascal Graf.


## What is this project about?
With this project unknown objects should be sorted automatically. The basis for decision-making is the clustering of data by using unsupervised learning.
The processing of the data is carried out with by a neural network.
####
The objects are guided over the conveyor belt and recorded by a camera. The collected data is then processed and sorted.
